# Changelog

All notable changes to the Desktop app are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## 0.18.3 – 2026-09-20

### Fixed
- Delegated same-origin camera and microphone access through the Desktop page and app iframe boundaries so Nextcloud Talk can enumerate devices in Chromium-based browsers, while keeping cross-origin frames blocked from those devices.
- Kept window-specific titles independent from launcher metadata refreshes, preventing file, folder, editor, and other dynamic window titles from intermittently reverting to the app name.
- Kept iframe accessible titles synchronized with visible window titles.
- Normalized app glyphs to dark foregrounds on light surfaces and light foregrounds on dark surfaces across window title bars, taskbar and dock entries, desktop and Apps-menu launchers, and embedded Nextcloud app/settings pages.
- Kept folder windows opened from the desktop on the Files app glyph instead of the white Nextcloud infinity mark, while restoring the administrator-configured Nextcloud logo on the separate new-tab shortcut.
- Upgraded restored same-host app-window URLs from HTTP to the active HTTPS origin so saved windows remain usable when the development instance moves to TLS.

## 0.18.2 – 2026-09-07

### Added
- Added a localized, theme-aware development-support callout to the personal and administrator settings, with a Ko-fi link that always opens in a separate browser tab.
- Added file and folder transfers between the Desktop and embedded native Nextcloud Files or experimental Desktop Files windows, and between Files windows, with Move by default, Ctrl to Copy, valid-target highlighting, and live arrow/plus feedback.
- Added Rename, Overwrite, and Cancel choices for drag-transfer name conflicts; overwrite requires explicit confirmation, folder overwrite replaces rather than merges the destination, and Cancel stops remaining items without rolling back completed transfers.
- Added compact, theme-aware indeterminate progress bars during drag-triggered Move/Copy operations, with cleanup and view refresh after success or failure.

### Changed
- Allowed accessible External Storage folders as the configured Desktop folder through Nextcloud's normal filesystem, while retaining the restrictions on incoming shares and Group/Team folders.
- Kept Desktop filesystem drag sources limited to genuine direct children of the configured Desktop folder, while allowing Favorites to provide real folder destinations without making special icons or application shortcuts transfer sources.

### Fixed
- Reworked the light and dark app icons as fill-based SVGs to improve rendering in the in-instance Nextcloud App Store.
- Corrected App Store screenshot metadata so Standard Light provides the small thumbnail while all four entries retain their full-resolution images without unnecessary CDATA wrappers.
- Fixed Desktop-to-native Files pointer drops independently of the experimental Desktop Files setting, including folder-row and current-folder background targets.
- Rejected invalid paths, same-parent no-ops, self/descendant targets, and conflict renames that would replace a source's ancestor; cleared stale cross-window drag state without using persistent drag payloads.
- Applied consistent shadows to filesystem icons, including Favorite files and folders.
- Corrected diagonal iframe-window resize cursors in Chromium while preserving the correct directions in Firefox.
- Completed Move-label translations across the locale set, corrected transfer-action wording, and localized rejected-transfer error messages.

## 0.18.1 – 2026-09-03

### Added
- Added a per-user 24-hour or 12-hour time-format preference that applies immediately.

### Changed
- Restored the digital clock, with the region-formatted date displayed beneath the time.
- Replaced version-suffixed static asset names with stable descriptive names and removed obsolete duplicate assets.

### Fixed
- Improved the alignment of Nextcloud notification and user controls in the Desktop header.
- Replaced English fallback text for the 12-hour and 24-hour clock settings across the locale set.

## 0.18.0 – 2026-09-03

### Changed
- Added compatibility with Nextcloud 35 while retaining support for Nextcloud 33 and 34.
- Replaced deprecated `NoAdminRequired` and `NoCSRFRequired` controller annotations with the supported PHP attributes used by current Nextcloud releases.
- Added a disposable Nextcloud 33–35 smoke matrix covering normal-user routes, CSRF-protected personal settings, and administrator-route authorization.

## 0.17.1 – 2026-08-01

### Added
- Added per-user dock visibility control so the dock can remain visible instead of hiding behind overlapping windows.
- Added a “Pin to dock” action to running app windows.
- Added an administrator control for showing the Nextcloud Files new-tab shortcut.

### Changed
- Moved Nextcloud controls, the clock, Files shortcut, and fullscreen control into the dock itself, with native menus positioned above it.
- Kept the localized date and time available in the shell controls.
- Applied the independently selected Standard, Redmond, or Retro icon style and light/dark palette to running app icons and every dock glyph without changing the selected window, taskbar, and menu decoration.
- Applied the Files-shortcut administrator policy immediately when its control changes, and showed the dock visibility setting only while dock mode is selected.

### Fixed
- Kept Euro-Office documents opened from embedded Nextcloud Files in Desktop windows, including when Euro-Office is configured to open files in a new tab, without changing Collabora handling.
- Extended the Euro-Office editor and status bar to the bottom edge of its Desktop window in both same-tab and new-tab modes.
- Made running pinned apps use the same task-button appearance as unpinned running apps, while keeping dock width and spacing correct.
- Prevented native Nextcloud header controls moved into the dock from being dragged onto the desktop and triggering file uploads.
- Stored taskbar/dock app pins and Apps-menu size in the user’s Nextcloud account instead of browser storage, including one-time migration of existing browser-local values.
- Corrected Dock false friends, generic window terminology, light/dark color-scheme wording, and British English spelling across the locale set while retaining appropriate technical and product names.

## 0.17.0 – 2026-07-25

### Added
- Added per-user radio choices for left- or right-side window controls; the left layout uses close, minimize, maximize order and right-aligned title text.
- Added a per-user taskbar or dock choice. Dock mode uses a centered bottom icon dock, a waffle Apps button, dock-specific pin wording, and a top utility bar for Nextcloud controls, date/time, the Files new-tab shortcut, and Desktop fullscreen.

### Changed
- Dock mode now uses a true floating overlay without reserving a full-width bottom row, auto-hides behind covering windows, and exposes a persistent bottom-edge reveal indicator.
- The dock Apps menu now opens centered above the waffle button, and the desktop icon grid uses the stage between the top utility bar and the bottom screen edge.
- Desktop-folder icons now update live through a keyed, in-place WebDAV reconciliation instead of requiring a visible full desktop reload.
- Window dragging now reveals subtle corner, side, and top snap targets, with the active target reinforced by the existing tile preview.
- The desktop rubber-band selection now combines a translucent accent fill, a subtle wallpaper hue/brightness shift, and contrasting light/dark edges so it remains visible on varied backgrounds.
- Retro desktop icons now use a stronger selected state while retaining the existing hover and keyboard-focus highlight.

### Fixed
- Completed a full semantic locale audit, replacing genuine English fallbacks while retaining established untranslated product, style, and technical terms per language.
- Kept maximized and top-corner-snapped window title bars below the dock-mode top utility bar.
- Maximize-button windows now fill the complete desktop stage, matching windows snapped to the top edge.
- Allowed fullscreen presentation from embedded app and external-site iframes in Chromium, including nested External Sites players such as Jellyfin.
- Restored distinct hover and selected highlights for independently configured Redmond and Retro desktop icons.
- Unified-search results now open exactly one Desktop Workspace window instead of being handled by both search-specific and generic header-link routers.

## 0.16.2 – 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Corrected false friends and misleading literal translations across the complete locale set, especially light/dark color modes, window-decoration terminology, and appearance-setting explanations.
- Replaced untranslated English fallbacks in the appearance, desktop-item, window-behavior, maintenance, app-launcher, fallback-window, and file-operation interfaces.

## 0.16.1 – 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Added real localized values for the appearance settings across the complete locale set instead of English fallback text.
- Made Apps-menu icon palettes and label styling update immediately when the icon color mode changes.

## 0.16.0 – 2026-07-13

### Added
- Added independent automatic or manual light/dark color modes for window and icon decorations.
- Added independent icon decoration choices for desktop icons, Apps menu icons, and pinned taskbar apps.

### Changed
- Reworked appearance settings into concise window and icon groups, with automatic Nextcloud matching as the default and manual controls revealed only when needed.
- When icons match the window decoration, both manual icon controls are disabled; manual icon color mode now offers only Nextcloud, light, or dark behavior.
- Reordered personal and administrator settings into clearer appearance, desktop-item, window-behavior, experimental, and maintenance sections.

### Fixed
- Standard icons now apply explicit light and dark palettes independently of the active Nextcloud appearance.
- Matched Firefox’s native Nextcloud settings scrolling model so embedded Desktop settings use only the app-content scroller, while keeping Firefox focus changes from shifting the hidden settings shell.
- Applied a full personal-settings reset immediately to both the open settings form and running Desktop, without requiring a reload.
- Made the embedded settings window use an opaque app-window background instead of exposing the full-page Nextcloud background.
- Completed the 0.16.0 translation audit, including previously untranslated app-menu, fallback-window, file-manager loading/empty/error, folder-tree, and delete-confirmation text.

## 0.15.3 – 2026-07-12

### Added
- Added the Retro desktop decoration with light and dark variants inspired by weathered, repurposed near-future hardware.

### Changed
- Retro styles windows, title-bar controls, the taskbar, Apps button, Apps menu, app tiles, and desktop context menus with dimensional worn-material surfaces and clipped industrial geometry.
- Redmond and Retro now carry their decoration onto pinned taskbar apps and every desktop icon type, including Home, Recycling Bin, pinned apps, favorites, folders, and files from the configured desktop folder.

### Fixed
- The image viewer now provides alphabetical previous/next navigation within the folder, fullscreen, wheel zoom, 1:1 and fit shortcuts, panning, and theme-aware backgrounds without the hover checkerboard.
- File windows remain open until the user explicitly closes them; the shell no longer guesses that a viewer was dismissed after 15 seconds.
- Bottom-right window resizing now uses only Desktop Workspace’s custom corner handle, avoiding Chromium’s overlapping native resize grip and the resulting jagged movement.
- Embedded app windows now leave scrolling to the iframe content, preventing a second outer scrollbar caused by Firefox’s iframe-height rounding.

## 0.15.2 – 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Files opened from the native Nextcloud Files window now use the same dedicated Desktop Workspace viewer iframe as desktop-folder and experimental Desktop Files entries.

## 0.15.1 – 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Window dragging now tracks the pointer directly in Chromium instead of applying overlapping geometry transitions that caused jagged, stuttery movement.

## 0.15.0 – 2026-07-10

### Added
- Added administrator-controlled per-user desktop decorations, including the Redmond light and dark variants.

### Changed
- Decoration changes apply live, and disabled user choices remain visible with administrator guidance.
- Redmond styles desktop windows, operation buttons, the taskbar, and desktop context menus without changing app content or menu structure.
- Added short, reduced-motion-aware animations for maximizing, restoring, minimizing, taskbar restoration, the Apps menu, and desktop context menus.
- Removed the Desktop debug-log settings and client logging feature.

### Fixed
- Administrator decoration policy changes save immediately and are enforced server-side.
- Redmond title-bar operation buttons use fixed square dimensions with lightly rounded corners and a matching dark palette.

## 0.14.4 – 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Localized app names after reload.** Desktop Workspace refreshes localized app names, shell labels, and restored app-window titles from Nextcloud navigation metadata when the desktop loads.
- **New-tab app tooltip.** External Sites entries that open outside Desktop Workspace now show a short apps-menu tooltip on hover indicating they open in a new tab.

### Fixed
- **Desktop drag responsiveness.** Localized app-title refreshes now update desktop-pinned app labels in place and no longer reload the desktop folder contents while the user is interacting with icons.
- **Nextcloud app-management preview thumbnail.** The app-store metadata now uses Nextcloud's documented single screenshot entry with `small-thumbnail` for the preview image and the full-resolution screenshot as the entry content, avoiding a low-resolution extra carousel slide on apps.nextcloud.com.

## 0.14.3 – 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Native Files iframe navigation behaves like desktop windows.** File rows open their viewer/editor in a separate Desktop Workspace iframe through the same `/f/{fileId}` dispatch that native Files uses, so Office documents are handed to the installed office suite instead of opening as plain folder windows. Middle-click/Ctrl-click on folders opens another Files iframe window instead of a browser tab, while normal folder clicks stay in the current iframe.

## 0.14.2 – 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Header menu native overlays stay native.** The account menu “About & What's new” entry is bound like the native status/QR controls and is no longer intercepted into a desktop iframe window, so Nextcloud can open its intended overlay.
- **Desktop icon highlighting is always visible.** Desktop icons now keep a very low-opacity highlight at rest, increase that highlight on hover/focus, and keep the existing selected-item highlight unchanged.
- **Desktop icon layout spacing avoids two-line overlap.** The desktop icon grid now uses a slightly taller cell so labels that wrap to two lines do not collide with icons below.
- **Transient button highlights clear after actions.** Fullscreen, titlebar window controls, and open-window task buttons blur after their click handling so they do not keep a pressed/focused-looking highlight after the action finishes.
- **Mobile taskbar controls are easier to reach.** Only when Desktop Workspace detects a mobile browser, the fullscreen button swaps places with the “Open Nextcloud Files in a new tab” button.

## 0.14.1 – 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Theming changes apply live from embedded Appearance settings.** When a desktop iframe is on `/settings/user/theming`, Desktop Workspace watches that same-origin settings page and mirrors theme, primary colour, text/background colours, and wallpaper changes onto the desktop shell without reloading `/apps/desktop_workspace`. The mirrored values remain stable after the settings iframe closes, Home and folder desktop icons follow primary-colour changes, Home uses the same themed squircle treatment as the Recycling Bin, the Recycling Bin icon keeps enough contrast in dark themes, window titlebars keep stacked title/subtitle text with normalized icon sizing, the Apps menu/taskbar/header popovers use the same translucent opacity as right-click menus, and app-menu buttons sit on a slightly more opaque surface with lower-opacity icon squircles that become fully opaque on hover.

## 0.14.0 – 2026-07-07

### Removed
- **Experimental URL windows.** Removed the arbitrary URL window launcher and its admin/personal settings. External Sites remains supported through the normal Nextcloud app navigation entries.

### Fixed
- **External Sites new-tab entries.** Desktop Workspace now preserves the navigation target flag used by External Sites for redirect/non-embeddable sites, so those entries open in a real browser tab instead of a desktop iframe window.
- **Apps menu always fits full rows.** The Apps menu keeps a minimum of three rows and four columns, can expand to additional columns, and expands its height for every required row so app icons are not squeezed or hidden in normal viewport sizes.
- **Apps menu rows remain reachable when resized small.** The launcher area now scrolls instead of hiding lower app rows when the Apps menu height is too small.

## 0.13.4 – 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **Native Files titlebar icons are stable across servers.** When a server only exposes the themed generic `file.svg` icon or the core mimetype alias list is unavailable on the Desktop route, opened Files windows now fall back to stable core filetype icons based on the filename extension, including titles with server-name suffixes such as `file.pdf - Example`.
- **Desktop and settings text updated.** Removed the proof-of-concept footer warning from the desktop, added a translations disclaimer to Desktop settings, and refreshed locale coverage.

## 0.13.3 – 2026-06-27

### Fixed
- **NC 34 app windows can frame same-origin content again.** Desktop Workspace and Desktop Files routes now set an explicit CSP allowing same-origin iframe windows.
- **Open-window task menus only show window actions.** Removed non-functional add/remove taskbar and desktop pin actions from taskbar buttons for already-open windows.
- **Native Files file windows use mimetype icons.** Embedded Files windows now prefer the actual file/viewer mimetype icon, then mimetype metadata, then filename fallback when updating titlebar and taskbar icons.

## 0.13.2 – 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Unified context menu hover styling.** Taskbar, Apps menu, desktop, and Desktop Files right-click menus now use the same translucent glass panel and the same native hover highlight.
- **Opened file windows show file identity.** Files opened through Desktop Files now keep the open file name in the window title/taskbar and use the file mimetype icon for PDFs, images, text files, and office documents instead of the generic Files icon.
- **Native Files window metadata follows navigation.** Embedded Nextcloud Files windows now show the current folder as the title and path as the subtitle, switch to the active file icon/title when a file viewer/editor opens inside the iframe, and restore the Files icon/folder title when the file closes.
- **Faster window closing.** Iframe windows now keep the graceful viewer cleanup request but remove the desktop shell window with a much shorter delay.

## 0.13.1 – 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **Pinned taskbar apps align cleanly.** Pinned app buttons are now vertically centered, use compact spacing, and show their app symbol inside a squircle instead of a wide rectangular button.
- **Apps menu spacing and minimum height.** Apps menu icons now use equal row and column spacing, the minimum height keeps labels visible, and the menu avoids scrollbars by sizing to fit all apps.
- **Translations filled in for 0.13 app-pinning labels.** Added missing labels such as add/remove from taskbar/desktop and pinned apps across locale files, and the taskbar date now formats with the active Nextcloud/browser language.

## 0.13.0 – 2026-06-24

### Added
- **NC34-style Apps menu.** The desktop Apps menu now uses the same grid-style app symbols as the native Nextcloud 34 header app menu, with app pin actions for the taskbar and desktop.
- **Unified search from the Apps menu.** The old app-filter search is replaced by a trigger for Nextcloud's native unified search overlay.
- **Pinned app areas.** Apps can be pinned to the taskbar or desktop; taskbar pinned apps can be reordered with drag-and-drop, and desktop-pinned apps use the same grid, selection and drag behavior as other desktop icons.
- **Resizable Apps menu.** The Apps menu can be resized upward and to the right, remembers its size, auto-aligns app icons, and enforces a minimum size that keeps every app visible.

### Changed
- **Desktop/taskbar polish.** The right-side Nextcloud taskbar logo now uses the same primary-color treatment as the Apps button, and desktop folder/special icon backgrounds derive from Nextcloud theme CSS colors.

### Fixed
- **Context menus close on click-away.** Apps and taskbar right-click menus now dismiss when clicking elsewhere on the desktop.
- **Resized desktop icon reflow is less surprising.** Icons that would move outside the right or bottom edge now clamp left/up from their saved grid cell instead of jumping back to the first free cells.

## 0.12.7 – 2026-06-23

### Changed
- **Taskbar buttons now stay on one row.** Open windows compress into a single horizontally scrollable taskbar row with full app names available via hover/accessible labels, matching common desktop OS taskbar behavior and avoiding hidden vertical rows.
- **Embedded app windows fit their content better.** Regular app iframes now fill the available window content area, while Dashboard keeps its native card-on-background layout.

### Fixed
- **Background iframe apps no longer raise on hover/focus.** Deck cards and similar embedded controls only bring their window forward after an intentional pointer press.
- **The taskbar height no longer changes when windows open.** Opening one app or overflowing many apps keeps the bottom taskbar at its fixed height.

## 0.12.6 – 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Admins can reset the desktop debug log.** The Desktop Environment admin settings now include a reset button that truncates the shared debug log without changing the debug-enabled setting.

### Fixed
- **Debug logging can be disabled again.** The admin settings script now reads the rendered debug checkbox id, so saving after unchecking debug logging no longer fails with a null checkbox error.
- **Notification popover interactions stay native.** Expanding or toggling notification content from the moved taskbar bell no longer closes the popover; only real notification target links are routed into desktop windows.
- **Missing desktop translations filled in.** The English, German and French l10n files now cover all statically detected translated strings, including the new debug-log reset labels.

## 0.12.5 – 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Account-menu no-op and overlay actions stay native.** Clicking the username keeps Nextcloud's default `href="#"` no-op behavior, while QR-code and User Status overlay controls are not converted into desktop windows.
- **The account root can be chosen as the desktop folder.** Choosing `/` is now saved as the active desktop folder instead of being treated like “no folder selected”.
- **Desktop folder icons better match Nextcloud Files.** Folder icons now use WebDAV share, owner, and mount metadata, so shared, group, and external/team-mounted folders use Nextcloud-style folder icons plus a shared-status badge.
- **Dropping computer files without a desktop folder no longer opens them in the browser.** The desktop now cancels the browser default from file `DataTransfer` items as well as populated file lists, and shows the normal drop frame with a grey disabled fill and a short notice while dragging, then ignores the drop. The handler runs at the desktop shell capture layer so drops on icons or child elements are caught too.

## 0.12.4 – 2026-06-19

### Changed
- **App id and folder renamed to `desktop_workspace`.** The app now uses the same id in `info.xml`,
  route names, translations, asset loading and the app folder, so it installs cleanly as
  `custom_apps/desktop_workspace` on Nextcloud 34.

### Fixed
- **Account-menu QR login works from the desktop taskbar.** The QR-code icon now reaches the native
  Nextcloud confirmation and QR login dialog instead of being swallowed by desktop link handling.
- **Account-menu status changing works from the desktop taskbar.** The “Set status” entry now opens
  the native user-status modal instead of opening another Desktop window inside Desktop.
- **Logout from the desktop taskbar user menu works.** Logout links bypass desktop window routing and
  navigate through Nextcloud's normal logout URL.
- **The bottom-right Nextcloud taskbar icon opens Files directly** (`/index.php/apps/files/`) instead
  of `/index.php`, so it does not reopen Desktop when Desktop is configured as the default app.
- **Desktop icons are safe on the right edge too.** Icon layout now treats the desktop as a bounded
  two-dimensional grid and temporarily reflows icons left when the usable area shrinks horizontally,
  matching the existing vertical safety behavior.
- **The experimental file browser checkbox no longer makes the personal settings view jump.** The
  settings section now has stable status sizing and disables scroll anchoring for that panel.

## 0.12.3 – 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Text / Markdown / HTML / code files now open through the Files app** (`/index.php/f/<id>`), the
  same path office documents already used, instead of the custom fullscreen viewer page whose
  layout overrides broke the Nextcloud Viewer's own modal header (the close/menu bar). The custom
  viewer page now handles only images, video, audio and PDF.
- **Header removal can no longer touch a modal/viewer header.** The page-header cleanup explicitly
  skips any `#header` that sits inside a `.modal-*`/`.viewer`/`#viewer` container, so the Viewer's
  `.modal-header` (close, actions) is always preserved.

## 0.12.2 – 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **Window chrome cleanup now removes the Nextcloud header instead of hiding it.** Hiding `#header`
  with `display:none` left layout/scroll artefacts for some apps (the Text editor lost its controls
  and didn't scroll). The header element is now removed from the embedded page, which renders
  cleanly across office files, images, video, PDF and the Text editor alike — so the per-type
  exception added in 0.12.1 is gone. Because Nextcloud apps may (re)mount their header after load, a
  short-lived observer keeps it removed for the first 15 seconds.

## 0.12.1 – 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Text/Markdown/HTML files keep their header in the window.** Files that Nextcloud opens in the
  Text editor render their controls (menu, close) into the standard header. The window chrome
  cleanup hid that header, removing those controls. These file types now keep the header (only the
  global app menu and search are hidden); office files, images, video and PDF are unchanged. The
  detected type list lives in `isTextViewerApp()` and is easy to extend.

## 0.12.0 – 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **Properties now reuses the standalone details page** (`/apps/desktop_workspace/files/details`) instead of
  trying to load the native Files sidebar. Right-click → *Properties* on the desktop opens a window
  with Details / Sharing / Activity / Versions. This works even when the Desktop Files manager is
  disabled, because the details page is a route of this app. (On Nextcloud 33/34 the native sidebar
  shell — `OCA.Files.Sidebar` — isn't loadable on a custom page without bundling the Files SPA, so
  this is both the reliable path and a clean base to extend later.)
- The details page now fills in missing metadata itself via a `PROPFIND`, so the desktop only needs
  to pass the file path.
- **Unified search is hidden** in the header for now.

### Added
- Nextcloud **34** is now supported (`max-version="34"`).

### Removed
- The experimental native-sidebar properties window (`properties-window.js`/`.css`) and the
  `LoadSidebar`/`addScript('files', …)` calls that came with it — which also clears the related CSP
  warnings on the desktop page.

## 0.11.4 – 2026-06-18

### Changed
- When the Files sidebar can't be found, the properties window now logs exactly which Files-related
  scripts are present on the page and what `OCA.Files` exposes — diagnostics to pin down how to load
  the sidebar shell on a custom page in this Nextcloud version.

## 0.11.3 – 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **CSP: inline image fallbacks removed.** Nextcloud's Content-Security-Policy blocks inline event
  handlers (`script-src-attr`), so the `onerror` fallbacks on preview thumbnails (desktop icons and
  Desktop Files) were blocked — broken previews didn't fall back to the mimetype icon. The fallback
  is now wired in JavaScript (a capturing `error` listener) instead of an inline attribute.

### Changed
- The right-click **Properties** action now always logs to the console (whether or not the
  properties module is reachable), to pin down why the sidebar isn't appearing.

## 0.11.2 – 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Properties window now has the sidebar to show.** The page only loaded the sidebar's *tabs*
  (via `LoadSidebar`), not the sidebar *shell* that defines `OCA.Files.Sidebar`. It now explicitly
  loads the Files sidebar script, so `OCA.Files.Sidebar` is available on the desktop page.
- **Stray drop frame / icon-image dragging (remaining edge cases).** Native drag is now cancelled
  for anything starting inside the icon layer, so a fast mouse flick can no longer grab a preview
  image and trigger the drop outline / accidental moves. Desktop icons only ever move via pointer
  events, so they never need native drag.

## 0.11.1 – 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- **Stray drop frame / accidental moves on the desktop.** Desktop icon images are now explicitly
  non-draggable. They were natively draggable (especially in Firefox, where `pointer-events: none`
  doesn't suppress image dragging), so repositioning icons or rubber-band selecting could start a
  parallel native image-drag — showing the upload/move outline and, on drop, moving favorites into
  the desktop folder.

### Changed
- **Properties** is now also available on favorites (not just desktop-folder files).
- The properties window logs each step to the console so a non-opening sidebar can be diagnosed
  (most likely cause: the Files sidebar scripts didn't load on the page).

## 0.11.0 – 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Properties window (experimental):** a right-click "Properties" on a desktop file opens the
  *real* Nextcloud Files sidebar — share, versions, tags, details — but as a floating desktop
  window instead of docked on the right. This reuses Nextcloud's own sidebar (`OCA.Files.Sidebar`)
  rather than reimplementing it: the page dispatches `\OCA\Files\Event\LoadSidebar` so the sidebar
  and its tabs are available, then the sidebar element is relocated into a desktop window.

### Notes
- This is a first iteration of the "reference Files, don't reinvent it" direction and needs
  verification on a live instance. Things to check in the browser: the sidebar's tabs still work
  after being relocated, and its actions menu / popovers position correctly when undocked.

## 0.10.2 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **The window title icon no longer gets “picked up” as an image** while dragging a window — it’s
  now non-draggable, so only the window moves.
- **File viewer (.txt/.md and others) keeps its title bar (modal header) and scrolls.** The
  dedicated viewer page now lays the Nextcloud viewer modal out as a header plus a scrollable
  content area, matching how it looks inside the full Files app.
- **“Set status” in the user menu** now opens the Nextcloud status overlay (like global search)
  instead of opening the desktop in a window — the user-status trigger is no longer captured as a
  window link.

### Changed
- The taskbar **date/time uses the same font as window titles** and is vertically centred.

## 0.10.1 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Windows can be dragged from the title and app icon too**, not just the empty part of the title
  bar; the grab/grabbing cursor now shows across the whole bar.
- **Apps restore at their last location after a browser reload.** Registered apps (Desktop Files,
  Nextcloud Files, etc.) reopened at the URL they were first opened with; they now reopen at the
  last URL the window was on. (Desktop Files’ folder is tracked via its in-app reports rather than
  the static iframe URL.)
- **Paste in the desktop right-click menu** only appears when there is actually something on the
  clipboard; a leftover clipboard from a previous session is cleared on load.

### Changed
- **Personal settings apply immediately** — the Save button is gone; toggling an option or picking
  a desktop folder takes effect right away (and live in the running desktop).

## 0.10.0 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Opening .txt/.md (and other files) from the desktop** no longer hangs on “Opening with the
  native Nextcloud viewer…”. The desktop now passes an absolute file path to the viewer, exactly
  like Desktop Files does.
- **The “+ New” menu in Desktop Files** is now a proper dropdown (it was always expanded because a
  CSS rule overrode the `hidden` attribute).

### Added
- **Drag-and-drop upload from your computer** onto the desktop uploads into the desktop folder,
  with a progress bar.
- **Full reset (user):** “Reset all desktop settings” clears every desktop setting, as if the
  desktop had never been opened.
- **Full reset (admin):** an admin can reset one user at a time from the admin settings (type or
  pick a user id), wiping that user’s desktop settings completely.
- **First-visit onboarding:** the very first time a user opens the desktop (and again after a full
  reset) their desktop settings open automatically.

### Changed
- **Personal settings reorganised** into Desktop icons → Desktop folder → Wallpaper → Experimental
  → Reset, with a **single Save button** and an **unsaved-changes reminder**. The folder picker now
  stages its choice and is applied on Save. A **Change wallpaper** button links to Nextcloud’s
  appearance settings in the same window.
- Wider desktop icon labels (about two more characters before wrapping); the icon image is
  unchanged.

## 0.9.0 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Iframe windows restore where you left them.** A window that browsed to another folder or opened
  a file (in the native Files app or in Desktop Files) now restores at that last location instead of
  the URL it was first opened with. In-iframe navigation is tracked even when the app routes
  client-side, and Desktop Files’ current folder is mirrored into the saved state.

### Added
- **Desktop right-click menu.** Right-clicking empty desktop space now offers: **New folder**
  (created in your desktop folder and shown immediately, no reload), **Paste** (when applicable),
  **Desktop Settings**, and — for administrators — **Desktop Admin Settings**.
- **Live desktop updates from Desktop Files.** Creating, uploading, moving, pasting, renaming or
  deleting in Desktop Files now refreshes the desktop immediately, so anything that lands in the
  desktop folder appears as an icon right away.
- **“+ New” menu in Desktop Files**, between the folder-content label and the clipboard bar, with
  **New folder**, **New text file** and **Upload files** (WebDAV `MKCOL`/`PUT`).
- **Settings apply live.** Saving desktop settings from the in-desktop settings window now applies
  to the running desktop immediately (favorites, desktop folder, Recycling Bin/Home toggles,
  confirmation options) without a reload. Theme/appearance changes already propagate via the
  desktop’s periodic appearance sync.

## 0.8.0 – 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Open windows persist per user.** A window’s size, position, stacking order and
  minimized/maximized state are now saved to your account (like desktop icon positions) and
  restored on your next visit, on any device. This replaces the previous per-browser
  (localStorage) persistence.
- **Stale windows are dropped on restore.** When the desktop reloads, a window is *not* restored if
  its app has been removed or disabled, or if the file/folder it was showing no longer exists. The
  pruned set is saved back so it stays clean.
- **“Reset open windows”** button in personal settings: closes all windows and clears their saved
  state (alongside the existing “Reset desktop icon positions”).

## 0.7.2 – 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **Desktop folder and favorites are now shown together.** When a desktop folder is set, the
  desktop shows the folder’s contents *and* your favorites (favorites are linked on the desktop,
  as before). An item that is both a folder member and a favorite appears only once, deduplicated
  by file id.
- **Favorites are always marked with a star**, independent of whether a desktop folder is set or
  which file manager is the default.

## 0.7.1 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Group folders and external storage can no longer be chosen as the desktop folder.** The
  ownership check now requires the folder to live on your own home storage, which also rejects
  group folders and external mounts (in addition to folders shared with you).
- **Favorite stars now actually appear.** Favorited items get the star marker both in
  desktop-folder mode and in the plain favorites view, regardless of which file manager is the
  default. (The star previously never rendered: favorites loaded as icons weren’t flagged as
  favorites, and the badge used a colour value that isn’t valid as an SVG attribute.)

### Added
- **Clipboard works across the desktop and the Desktop File Manager.** Cut or copy on the desktop
  and paste inside Desktop Files — or the other way round. The clipboard is shared between them, and
  the Desktop Files paste button reflects what was copied on the desktop. (Available when the
  Desktop File Manager is enabled.)
- **Drag and drop between the desktop and Desktop Files.** Drag a file from a Desktop Files window
  onto the desktop to move it into your desktop folder, or drag a desktop icon onto a Desktop Files
  window to move it into that window’s current folder. Both views refresh afterwards.

## 0.7.0 – 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Desktop folder.** In personal settings you can now pick one of your **own** folders and have
  its contents shown on the desktop as icons. Only folders you own are accepted — folders shared
  with you (and external storages) are rejected server-side with a clear message. Leave it empty
  to keep the previous favorites-as-icons behaviour.
- **Favorite markers.** When a desktop folder is set and favorites are enabled, items in that
  folder that are favorites are marked with a star badge, the way Nextcloud Files shows favorites.
- **Right-click file operations** on desktop-folder items: Open, Download, Rename, Add/Remove
  favorite, and **Move to deleted files**. Cut / Copy / Paste are available **only when the
  experimental Desktop File Manager is enabled**; paste targets the desktop folder, and an empty
  spot on the desktop offers Paste as well.
- **Drag onto the Recycling Bin** to delete. Dropping an icon on the Bin moves it to deleted
  files, with a confirmation dialog and a “Don’t ask again” option (also a checkbox in personal
  settings, mirroring the favorites behaviour). The Bin highlights while you drag over it.

### Changed
- Removed the light overlay (“haze”) that sat over the wallpaper in light themes — the wallpaper
  is now shown exactly as provided.

### Notes
- **Deletions always go through the Recycling Bin.** Every delete here is a plain WebDAV `DELETE`
  on the files endpoint, which moves the item to *Deleted files*; nothing is ever permanently
  removed by the desktop. Restore from the Recycling Bin as usual.
- The folder picker uses the standard Nextcloud file dialog restricted to folders. Ownership is
  validated on the server when you save, so a shared folder chosen by mistake is refused.

## 0.6.3 – 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **Design-guideline pass** over everything added since 0.1.11. Aligned the desktop icons,
  context menu, confirmation dialog, group multiselect, multi-window cards, usage-stats table
  and file thumbnails to the official Nextcloud design tokens: `--border-radius-element/-small/
  -container/-pill`, `--default-clickable-area` (34px min for menu items, options and buttons),
  `--default-font-size`/`--font-size-small`, `--color-box-shadow`, and the primary/border/hover
  color variables (replacing hardcoded radii, sizes and the legacy `--border-radius-large`).
- The **Recycling Bin** icon now uses an inline **Material Design** icon instead of the
  `core/img` delete icon (deprecated since NC 25). The white tile for Home and Bin is kept.

### Notes
- The full-screen shell chrome (windows, taskbar, start menu) keeps its own visual identity by
  design; the guideline’s nav→content app layout does not apply to it. The right-click menu
  follows Nextcloud’s popover *styling* conventions rather than the three-dot `popovermenu`
  markup, since it opens at the cursor rather than from a three-dot trigger.

## 0.6.2 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Desktop icon labels get a **white shadow under light themes** (where the text is dark) and
  keep the black shadow under dark themes, so labels stay readable on any wallpaper.
- **Icons can no longer end up behind the taskbar.** Placement and drops are constrained to
  the space above the taskbar. When the window/stage shrinks, overflowing icons reflow upward
  within the grid, and return to their saved positions once there is room again — unless one of
  the reflowed icons is moved, in which case its new position is saved.

## 0.6.1 – 2026-06-16

### Changed
- **Desktop icon positions now persist in the user profile** (server-side) instead of per
  browser, so they follow the user to other machines. Saved (debounced) whenever icons move.

### Added
- Personal settings button **"Reset desktop icon positions"** that clears the stored layout
  and returns to the standard arrangement.

## 0.6.0 – 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Admin: multiple windows per app.** A "Multiple windows" section in Desktop Environment
  lets admins pick (in a card grid) which apps users may open in more than one window. File
  managers always allow multiple windows.
- **Admin: usage statistics.** Shows instances in use right now, unique users per day (last 7
  days) and per week (last 4 weeks). Counts only — it records *how many* users use Desktop,
  never *who*; a user who opens Desktop many times in a day counts once for that day.

### Changed
- Recycling Bin now opens the **trashbin** view (`/apps/files/trashbin`) instead of the home
  folder, and uses the dark bin icon so it is visible on its light tile.
- The **Home** folder icon now takes the first grid cell; other icons flow after it.
- Personal settings now state clearly that **favorites are links**, not copies — removing a
  favorite icon never deletes the file or folder.

## 0.5.0 – 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Show Recycling Bin** (personal setting): a Recycling Bin desktop icon, placed right after
  the favorites. Opens deleted files in the Nextcloud file manager. Movable like favorites.
- **Show Home Folder** (personal setting): a "Home" folder icon on the desktop that opens the
  user's root folder in their default file manager.
- **Multi-select on the desktop:** drag a rubber-band rectangle on empty desktop to select
  several icons, and Ctrl/Cmd-click to toggle individual icons. Right-click acts on the whole
  selection, and selected icons can be dragged and re-gridded together.

### Changed
- The "Try out Desktop File Manager" personal option is now hidden when the admin has disabled
  it for everyone — unless the user is in an allowed test group. (When the admin disables it
  after a user opted in, that user is already served Nextcloud Files automatically.)
- Removed the Reload-desktop button for now.

## 0.4.2 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Reload desktop** now also applies Nextcloud appearance/theme changes (re-syncs stylesheets
  and theming styles) and the changed **preferred file manager** — the apps menu and favorite
  folder opening switch between Files and Desktop Files without a page reload.
- Reload button is now vertically centred in the header bar.
- Favorite **folders** opened in Desktop Files now show their path and use the app title
  ("Desktop Files" / "Files") as the window title — the file manager now reports its path to
  the correct window (also fixes meta for multiple Desktop Files windows).
- Favorite **files** now open exactly as they do inside Desktop Files (the viewer), regardless
  of whether the Desktop file manager is enabled — instead of just opening a file manager.

## 0.4.1 – 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Clicking a tiled/snapped window's titlebar now just focuses it. It only leaves the tile and
  returns to its previous size once you actually drag it.

### Changed
- Favorites open in the user's default file manager: **Desktop Files** when that's enabled,
  otherwise **Nextcloud Files** (Desktop Files now accepts an initial `?dir=`).
- Multiple windows from the apps menu are now limited to the **file managers** (Desktop Files
  / Nextcloud Files). All other apps open a single window again.

### Added
- **Reload desktop** button (circle-arrow, right of unified search) — refreshes the desktop
  favorites and reloads stylesheets to pick up appearance changes. It does **not** reload the
  page or any open windows or their contents.
- Removed the header contacts menu from the taskbar (the Contacts app remains available).

## 0.4.0 – 2026-06-16

### Added
- **Show Favorites on Desktop** (personal setting). Nextcloud favorites render as desktop
  icons (same previews/mimetype icons as Files), freely arrangeable in a non-overlapping grid
  with positions remembered. Drag to rearrange (snaps to the nearest free cell),
  double-click to open, right-click for a menu.
- **Remove from favorites** from the icon's right-click menu, with a confirmation dialog and a
  "Don't ask again" option. The same preference is available in personal settings
  ("Don't ask for confirmation before removing a favorite").
- **Window resizing** by dragging any side or corner (8 handles, with minimum size and stage
  clamping).
- **Window snapping / tiling** (Windows-style): drag a window's titlebar to the left/right
  edge to tile 50%, to a corner for a 25% quarter, to the top-middle to maximize. A live
  preview shows the target; dragging a tiled window restores its floating size.

### Changed
- Apps opened from the apps menu now allow **multiple windows** of the same app
  (as Desktop Files already did).

## 0.3.1 – 2026-06-16

### Added
- Taskbar **fullscreen toggle** (left of the apps menu), tooltip "Toggle fullscreen".
- Credit (bottom right) now also shows "Proof of Concept – may contain errors" and the
  running **Nextcloud server version**.

### Changed
- Removed the wallpaper heading/intro text from the stage.
- **"Open Nextcloud"** logo now opens Nextcloud in a **new browser tab**.
- **Desktop Files** uses the **same icons/previews as Nextcloud Files** (preview thumbnails
  where available, mimetype icons otherwise).
- **Admin group allow-list fixed:** the group list is now the *testing exception* — editable
  only while the file manager is disabled for everyone, greyed out when it is enabled for
  everyone. Presented as a Nextcloud-style searchable token dropdown.

## 0.3.0 – 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Desktop settings.** A personal settings page ("Desktop") with an opt-in checkbox
  "Try out Desktop File Manager – Experimental". By default, Nextcloud Files stays the
  standard file manager; the Desktop file manager is opt-in.
- **Admin category "Desktop Environment"** with: "Disable experimental Desktop File Manager
  for everyone", a group allow-list that greys out when disabled, and the debug-log toggle
  (moved here, behaviour unchanged).
- Cogwheel in the apps menu (right of the search box) that opens the user's Desktop settings;
  tooltip "Desktop Settings".

### Changed
- The Desktop file manager now only appears for users who are allowed (not globally disabled,
  in an allowed group if a list is set) and have opted in. Everyone else uses Nextcloud Files.

## 0.2.5 – 2026-06-15

### Added
- Wallpaper credit (bottom-right): "Desktop by canisdata.de" and the live app version.

### Changed
- Window dragging bounds: a window may now move off-frame to the left (stopping while the
  reload button stays ~one cursor-width from the edge), is limited on the right to the app
  icon, and its titlebar can no longer move below the taskbar. The app icon and name are no
  longer a drag handle and show the default cursor.

### Fixed
- Files icon paths no longer hardcode `/custom_apps/…`; they resolve via `OC.imagePath`, so
  the app works whether it is installed under `apps/` or `custom_apps/`.

## 0.2.4 – 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- Account-menu items now reliably open in their own desktop windows. The account menu
  (NcListItem inside an NcPopover) detaches the anchor on pointerdown, swallowing the click,
  so interception now happens on pointerdown; the click handler suppresses native navigation.
  Opens are de-duplicated by window id.

## 0.2.3 – 2026-06-15

### Added
- Sidebar info (ⓘ) trigger at the end of each row opens the details sidebar; an X in the
  sidebar header closes it. Selecting a file no longer auto-opens the sidebar.
- Sharing in the sidebar: an internal link (`/f/<id>`) for people who already have access,
  plus user/group/team sharing backed by the OCS sharees search.
- Resizable tree column (the current width is the minimum).
- Per-window reload button (left of minimize, divider, "Refresh content").

### Changed
- Toolbar is a grid mirroring the main columns, so "Tree View" / "Folder content" align with
  their columns and the clipboard sits beside them.

### Fixed
- Header-menu items open in windows (first iteration).
- Contacts-menu avatar no longer grows in width (was wrongly matched by the menu positioner).
- Dark logo in light mode: the taskbar logo (cloned from the dark header) now gets a
  brightness-aware contrast filter, re-applied on appearance changes.

## 0.2.2 – 2026-06-15

### Added
- Multi-select in the file list: Shift-click for a contiguous range, Ctrl/Cmd-click for a
  disparate selection.
- Copy / Cut / Paste via server-side WebDAV COPY / MOVE.
- Name-collision dialog (Keep both / Overwrite / Skip / Cancel) with an "apply to all"
  option scoped to the operation. Rename inserts the next free integer before the extension
  and is compound-extension aware (e.g. `archive.tar.gz` → `archive_1.tar.gz`).
- Confirmation before a cut/paste (move), none before copy/paste.

## 0.2.1 – 2026-06-15

### Changed
- **Merged the `desktopfiles` app into `desktop`** as a self-contained `files` module
  (`templates/files/`, `js/files/`, `css/files/`, `lib/Controller/FilesController`). The app
  is now a single store-publishable folder.
- Toolbar relabelled: Up / Refresh / Open-in-Files as glyphs/icon with tooltips; "Tree View"
  and "Folder content" labels; in-toolbar title removed (the window titlebar already shows it).
- h1 changed from "Nextcloud Desktop" to "Desktop in Nextcloud".

### Added
- Makefile that builds a single-top-level-folder, store-ready tarball and signs it when a
  certificate is present.
- Translations merged into the `desktop` namespace (de / en / fr).

### Removed
- Dead/duplicate assets: superseded shell scripts (`-release`, `-headerfix`, `-menualign`),
  `viewer2`–`viewer9` duplicates, and dev/release twins that were byte-identical.
